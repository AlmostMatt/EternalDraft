For cards, identify the following:
name, colors, cost, type (unit/spell/weapon/...)
optionally identify evasive units and removal
Card info can be found at:

Find a nice way to store and access these card information constants. Possibly as fixtures.

For decks, count the following:
units, spells, power cards, influence (for each of FTPJS)
These can be aggregates or actual fields

Identify which colors are being splashed in a deck (<= 5 cards of a color)
Add 'is_splash' attribute to the contains relationship

Update new_deck to handle bad inputs

For card and deck previews, use the color icons instead of the letters (FTJPS are red, yellow, green, blue, dark purple)
